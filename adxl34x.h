    These bits indicate the first axis involved in a tap or activity
    event. A setting of 1 corresponds to involvement in the event,
    and a setting of 0 corresponds to no involvement. When new
    data is available, these bits are not cleared but are overwritten by

    clears the corresponding source bit when the next activity or
    single tap/double tap event occurs.

    A setting of 1 in the asleep bit indicates that the part is asleep,

    Link Bit 
    A setting of 1 in the link bit with both the activity and inactivity
    functions enabled delays the start of the activity function until
    inactivity is detected. After activity is detected, inactivity detection
    begins, preventing the detection of activity. This bit serially links
    the activity and inactivity functions. When this bit is set to 0,
    the inactivity and activity functions are concurrent. Additional
    information can be found in the Link Mode section.
    When clearing the link bit, it is recommended that the part be
    placed into standby mode and then set back to measurement
    mode with a subsequent write. This is done to ensure that the
    device is properly biased if sleep mode is manually disabled;
    otherwise, the first few samples of data after the link bit is cleared
    may have additional noise, especially if the device was asleep
    when the bit was cleared.
    AUTO_SLEEP Bit 
    If the link bit is set, a setting of 1 in the AUTO_SLEEP bit enables
    the auto-sleep functionality. In this mode, the ADXL345 automatically
    switches to sleep mode if the inactivity function is
    enabled and inactivity is detected (that is, when acceleration is
    below the THRESH_INACT value for at least the time indicated
    by TIME_INACT). If activity is also enabled, the ADXL345
    automatically wakes up from sleep after detecting activity and
    returns to operation at the output data rate set in the BW_RATE
    register. A setting of 0 in the AUTO_SLEEP bit disables automatic
    switching to sleep mode. See the description of the Sleep Bit in
    this section for more information on sleep mode.
    If the link bit is not set, the AUTO_SLEEP feature is disabled
    and setting the AUTO_SLEEP bit does not have an impact on
    device operation. Refer to the Link Bit section or the Link Mode
    section for more information on utilization of the link feature.
    When clearing the AUTO_SLEEP bit, it is recommended that the
    part be placed into standby mode and then set back to measurement
    mode with a subsequent write. This is done to ensure that
    the device is properly biased if sleep mode is manually disabled;
    otherwise, the first few samples of data after the AUTO_SLEEP
    bit is cleared may have additional noise, especially if the device
    was asleep when the bit was cleared.
    Measure Bit 
    A setting of 0 in the measure bit places the part into standby mode,
    and a setting of 1 places the part into measurement mode. The
    ADXL345 powers up in standby mode with minimum power
    consumption.
    Sleep Bit 
    A setting of 0 in the sleep bit puts the part into the normal mode
    of operation, and a setting of 1 places the part into sleep mode.
    Sleep mode suppresses DATA_READY, stops transmission of data
    to FIFO, and switches the sampling rate to one specified by the
    wakeup bits. In sleep mode, only the activity function can be used.
    When the DATA_READY interrupt is suppressed, the output
    data registers (Register 0x32 to Register 0x37) are still updated
    at the sampling rate set by the wakeup bits (D1:D0).
    When clearing the sleep bit, it is recommended that the part be
    placed into standby mode and then set back to measurement
    mode with a subsequent write. This is done to ensure that the
    device is properly biased if sleep mode is manually disabled;
    otherwise, the first few samples of data after the sleep bit is
    cleared may have additional noise, especially if the device was
    asleep when the bit was cleared.

    described in Table 20.*/
